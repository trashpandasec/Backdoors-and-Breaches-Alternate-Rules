Some coworkers and I tried out the base game and loved it. 

However after the first round we started arguing about adversary behaviour and providing additional bonuses/ hinderances to the defenders. 

We came up with the concept of knowledge checks that can be introduced prior to an action. For example if you're looking to detect exfil of data over DNS a simple knowledge check can be: "What port and protocol does DNS use" a correct answer would then give you a +1 modifier to your roll.
